## Let's hack!

- Find the longest word in a string.

  - Given `The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog` is the input to your function, it should return `jumped`.

  ```
    const getLongestWord = (inputstr) => {
      let longstr = "";
      inputstr.split(" ").forEach((el) => {
        longstr = longstr.length > el.length ? longstr : el;
      });
      return longstr;
    };
    getLongestWord("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog");
  ```

- Repeat a string `n` times.

  - If `abc` and `3` are the arguments to your function, it shoudl return `abcabcabc`

    ```
      const makeRepeatString = (str, n) => {
        return str.repeat(n);
      };
      makeRepeatString("abc", 3);

    ```

- Remove duplicates in an array

  - If `[1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3]` is the input to your
    function, it should return `[1, 20, 3]`

    ```
      const removeDuplicates = (arr) => {
        return arr.length ? [...new Set(arr)] : [];
      };
      removeDuplicates([1, 20, 3, 1, 3, 3]);
    ```

- Remove falsy values

  - If `[42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"]` is the input to your function, it should return `[42, "everything", 2, "everything"]`

    ```
      const removeFalsy = (arr) => {
        return arr.length
        ? arr.filter((el) => {
        if (el) return el;
        })
        : [];
      };
      removeFalsy([42, "everything", "", 2, false, "everything"]);
    ```

- Truncate a string

  - If `'Absolute victory'` and `3` are the inputs to
    your function, it should return `Abs...`

    ```
      const addEllipsis = (str, n) => {
        return str.slice(0, 3).concat("...");
      };
      addEllipsis("Absolute victory", 3);
    ```
